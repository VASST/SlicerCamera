# SlicerCamera
An extension for interacting, calibrating, and using cameras in [3D Slicer](https://www.github.com)

## Current Modules
The following modules are currently implemented:

### Camera Calibration


## Future Work
The following ideas may be implemented in the future:

### Camera Capture
Wrap the OpenCV camera capture interface into a module so that Slicer can interact with webcams directly

### Stereo Cameras
A number of modules for calibrating and registering stereo cameras from within Slicer
